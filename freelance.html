                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    As a freelancer, my job is to work alongside clients to take their ideas and turn them into real,
                     efficient, succesful products. To achieve this, I wear many hats during the creative process, designing,
                      conducting UX research, and creating brand strategies.

                    Here are a few examples of real-life work.

                <h3>UX Research</h3>
                <p>
                    I conduct primary and secondary UX research, including exploratory, user, and value testing. I deliver in-depth UX reports with design suggestions and create wireframes and prototypes for clients who have an idea, an MVP, or an established product. This comes with one or more consultations, where I help them further understand what works for their products, who it works for, and why.

This usually precedes the design phase, where designs are fleshed out and a product starts to take form. Below are a examples of wireframes off a UX Research report regarding messaging apps:

            <div class="website-section">
                <h3>Design</h3>
                <p>The design process is where projects start to come to life. Following research, I design the solutions best fitted for each client and case, 
                    iterating with them all throughout to make sure the final product is exactly what they had in mind and implementing features that make the product 
                    more efficient and user-friendly.</p>
