                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    I was the first designer at VoxPop, a platform currently in beta with a focus on open, fact-based communication. 
                    My responsibilities included taking the wireframes our CEO and founder made and creating the first full approach to an MVP, 
                    onboarding the second product designer when they started, being the main advisor in terms of accessibility and interface gamification,
                    and writing the company's documentation from scratch.

                    As the app is currently in alpha, I am unable to publish screenshots of my work, however I can discuss it 1-on-1 if need be!

            <div class="Redesign-section">
                <h3>Design</h3>
                <p>
                    My first task at the job was to gather all the data and wireframes for the CEO, organize it (and the files), and start
                     working on the very first MVP draft, to be shared with the team to gather feedback and any missing information. After this,
                     I onboarded a  new product designer and we divided the tasks - I worked mainly on web and they focused on mobile adaptation.
                     Sometimes, to get a new set on eyes on our workload, we switched responsibilities for a week.

                    <br><br>

                    I oversaw the evolution of the design and advised on making the app more compliant with A11Y standards. I then introduced some 
                    gamification mechanics when the CEO expressed interest, and gave pointers to the team along the way to further develop them.

                    <br><br>
                    When we were getting close to a full hand-off of the MVP, I approached the CEO with a new project - the branding and marketing of 
                    the MVP. Together we were able to broach the at first seemingly contradicting factor of having an invite-only platform be about open
                     communication. For this I focused on the issue of moderation - being invite-only allows us to be able to keep the community separate from
                      bots and toxic accounts and be able to expand the community in a controlled manner, so we would never get to a point where there were too many people
                       for the team to keep moderating for.
