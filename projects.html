                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    As a freelancer, my job is to work alongside clients to take their ideas and turn them into real, efficient, succesful products. To achieve this, I wear many hats during the creative process, designing, conducting UX research, and creating brand strategies. 
                    <br><br>Here are a few examples of real-life work.
                </p>

                <h3>UX Research</h3>
                <p>
                    I conduct primary and secondary UX research, including exploratory, user, and value testing. I deliver in-depth UX reports with design suggestions and create wireframes and prototypes for clients who have an idea, an MVP, or an established product.
                     This comes with one or more consultations, where I help them further understand what works for their products, who it works for, and why.
                    <br> <br>
                    This usually precedes the design phase, where designs are fleshed out and a product starts to take form. Below are a examples of the very first wireframes off a UX Research report regarding messaging apps, focusing solely on layout and ease of use:</p>

                <h3>The M Company</h3>
                <p>I founded The M Company in March 2017. It was a bootstrapped tech startup focused on simplifying and optimizing existing technology to get the most productivity and efficiency out of them.
                    <br><br>
                    At The M Company, I was responsible for product design, research, and development. I also took care of its corporate identity and social media presence. Its products have been featured on international media, and nominated for a PH award.</p>
